      <h1>8 Places to be When You’re Under 21 in Kansas City</h1>
      <p>It can be hard being under 21 in a city in the Midwest. Here's some places I loved growing up in KC.</p>

      <section class="location-holder">

					<h2>Prospero's Books</h2>
					<address>
						1800 W 39th St<br>
						Kansas City, MO <br>
						64111<br>
						<a href="tel:+18168319573">(816) 531-9673</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="https://prosperosbookstore.com/">Visit Prospero's website</a></p>
					<p>This quaint three-story bookstore is a beautiful backdrop for an afternoon with friends, a date, or just some alone time. Make sure you stay for the local live music upstairs!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

					<h2>The Nelson Atkins</h2>
					<address>
						44525 Oak St<br>
						Kansas City, MO <br>
						64111<br>
						<a href="tel:+18167511278">(816) 751-1278</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="https://www.nelson-atkins.org/">Visit The Nelson Atkins' website</a></p>
					<p>Oh you know, just the world class museum in the heart of the Art District. I've been more times than I can count, and I still haven't seen everything. Did I mention it's free?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<h2>The Plaza</h2>
					<address>
						9033 Manchester Road<br>
						Kansas City, MO <br>
						64112<br>
						<a href="tel:+18167530100">(816) 753-0100</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="https://countryclubplaza.com/">Visit The Plaza's website</a></p>
					<p>One part place to spend money, one part place to walk around: a midwesterner's two favorite things! I specifically recommend The Big Cheddar.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<h2>Roanoke Park</h2>

						Kansas City, MO <br>
						64111<br>
						<a href="tel:+18165137500">(816) 513-7500</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="https://kcparks.org/places/roanoke-park">Visit Roanoke Park's website</a></p>
					<p>This is just a quite park in a neighborhood not far from the state line. The best part is that there's playgrounds made much more the size for adults/teens. A fun place to spend a nice day.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

					<h2>Crown Center Ice Skating</h2>
					<address>
						2425 Grand Blvd<br>
						Kansas City, MO <br>
						64108<br>
						<a href="tel:+18162748411">(816) 274-8411</a>
					</address>
					<p><a href="https://www.crowncenter.com/iceterrace">Visit Crown Center Ice Skating's website</a></p>
					<p>This is dependant on the time of year of course, but for a reasonable price you can enjoy one of the few benefits to it being so damn cold in KC: ice!&nbsp; Once you're done you can enjoy the Christmas village set up around the place too. Perfect for pictures.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<h2>Grinter’s Sunflower farm</h2>
					<address>
						24154 Stillwell Rd<br>
						Lawrence, KS <br>
						66044<br>
					</address>
					<p><a href="http://www.kansastravel.org/lawrence/grinterssunflowerfarm.htm">Visit Grinter’s Sunflower Farm's website</a></p>
					<p>If it's not time for iceskating, it's probably time for sunflowers! Just a short (40 min) drive from downtown, you can marvel at sunflower fields as far the eye can see. There's no better place to see it than Kansas. While you're there, stop by Lawrence!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

					<p>Of the few reasons to visit Swope Park... well this is the only reason to visit Swope Park (kidding!). A beautiful conservation focused zoo. Fun fact: if there's a heat advisory, discount tickets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
