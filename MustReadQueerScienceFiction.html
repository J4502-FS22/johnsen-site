      <h1>Must Read Queer Science Fiction</h1>
<p>Queer people love science fiction. It’s a science fact! As a scientist myself (BA in linguistics), I’ve compiled this empirically verifiable definitive list of things you simply have to read in the genre.</p>

          <p>One of the strangest, yet most compelling graphic novels best read while society teeters on the edge of transcendent change due to unchecked capitalism. So, like right now. Taking place in a high-school-tinged, not-McDonalds where a few lucky guests get a glimpse of something not-meant-to-be-seen, a couple of girlfriends make a practical decision.</p>

          <p>It says it on the cover: “Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic mansion in space!” What else did you want me to say! It’s a wild ride with some weird pacing that combines your favorite stuff from the YA genre and excludes everything that makes YA garbage (kidding).</p>

          <p>Every person has felt that like leaving your life as a tea-monk behind and wandering into the robot infested woods before, right? Whether you have or not, you’ve definitely felt the draw to something new. A story about friendship and pilgrimage set in a beautiful near-miss with an apocalypse, A Psalm for the Wild-Built feels like a deep breath, or a warm cup of tea. </p>

          <p>If you’re tired of working as a contract killing machine and would rather be watching your favorite episode of Sailo- I mean Sanctuary Moon, this series of novelas and one full-sized novel is for you. Also you’re literally a killing machine / human hybrid. And you’ve hacked your governance module that keeps you from killing your human clients. Where was this metaphor going? Anyway, the self-named titular protag Murderbot cares much more about protecting the people he grows close to than murdering anyone. There’ll still be murder though. </p>

          <p>Space Lesbians!!! Part TWO ! There can never be too many on a given list. In this razor sharp political drama written by an anthropologist, explore the heart of the Teixcalaan Empire - equal parts beautiful and deadly. Just when you think you’ve seen what these characters are capable of… the books ends. Good thing there’s a sequel! (You’ll wanna read it.) </p>

          <p>An icy planet. A people to whom binary gender is perverse. A male envoy feeling pretty weird right about now. An albeit underwhelming title for a masterwork of science fiction by the most powerful writer in the genre who changed what it meant to be a “sci-fi” writer. If you only read one work of Ursela K. Le Guin, let it be this one. </p>

          <p>I saved the best for last. Becky Chambers is the most phenomenal Sci Fi writer working today, in addition to being the best character writer decades. A series of space operas with characters you’ll love the moment you lay eyes on the page. Light-hearted, punchy and profound, if you read one series on this list, let it be this one. </p>
